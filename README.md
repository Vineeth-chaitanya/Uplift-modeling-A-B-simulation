# Problem Statement
How can we maximize incremental conversions [`placing an order`] without wasting incentives on users who would have converted anyway?

## Solution 
Design a controlled experimentation framework that first estimates the average impact of a promotion using A/B Testing and then extend to individual level causal inference using Uplift Modeling.

## Data
